Hey, I'm Vyas 👋  
Second-year engineering student • Full-stack dev • Hackathon warrior • Workflow whisperer

🎯 Mission: Build reproducible, emotionally resonant tech that actually works under demo pressure  
💡 Philosophy: If it can't be explained in a meme or a README, it's not ready for teammates  
🎤 Fun fact: I once wrote a motivational rap for a demo—and it slapped harder than the backend
